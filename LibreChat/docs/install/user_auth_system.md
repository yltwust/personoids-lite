# User/Auth System

## **First Time Setup**

In order for the auth system to function properly, there are some environment variables that are needed. Note that this information is also included in the [/.env.example](/.env.example) file.

In /.env, you will need to set the following variables:
```bash
# Change this to a secure string
JWT_SECRET=secret
# Set the expiration delay for the secure cookie with the JWT token
# Delay is in millisecond e.g. 7 days is 1000*60*60*24*7
SESSION_EXPIRY=1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7
DOMAIN_SERVER=http://localhost:3080
DOMAIN_CLIENT=http://localhost:3080
```

*Please Note: If you are wanting this to work in development mode, you will need to create a file called `.env.development` in the root directory and set `DOMAIN_CLIENT` to `http://localhost:3090` or whatever port  is provided by vite when runnning `npm run frontend-dev`*

Important: When you run the app for the first time, you need to create a new account by clicking on "Sign up" on the login page. The first account you make will be the admin account. The admin account doesn't have any special features right now, but it might be useful if you want to make an admin dashboard to manage other users later. 

⚠️ **__For the first time, you should use a local account (email and password) to sign up and log in.__**

## **Email and Password Reset** 

Most of the code is in place for sending password reset emails, but is not yet feature-complete as I have not setup an email server to test it. Currently, submitting a password reset request will then display a link with the one-time reset token that can then be used to reset the password. Understanding that this is a considerable security hazard, email integration will be included in the next release.

## **Disable User Registration**

To disable or re-enable registration, open up the root `.env` file and set `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true` or `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` depending on if you want registration open or closed.

### ⚠️***Warning***

If you previously implemented your own user system using the original scaffolding that was provided, you will no longer see conversations and presets by switching to the new user system. This is because of a design flaw in the scaffolding implementation that was problematic for the inclusion of social login.

### For user updating from an older version of the app:

When the first account is registered, the application will automatically migrate any conversations and presets that you created before the user system was implemented to that account. 
if you use login for the first time with a social login account (eg. Google, facebook, etc.), the conversations and presets that you created before the user system was implemented will NOT be migrated to that account.
